<!--

Wiggle effect animation: Background gradient is aligned vertically and will change rotation a few degrees in +/-X during scrolling. The setting should be decent, as strong flickering might be hard on the eyes.

To be evaluated: Attaching the gradient from left to right might be more decent, if appropriate, close colors are chosen. This could work better for long, narrow pages, but less well on short, wide ones.
