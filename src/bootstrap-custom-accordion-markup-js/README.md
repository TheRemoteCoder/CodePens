# Bootstrap â€“ Custom accordion markup  + JS

Accordions with Bootstrap styling but custom behaviour, in two HTML markup flavours. These variants can be useful if a system doesn't support Bootstrap JS or the data-attributes it needs for functionality. Examples: CMS editors might sanitize such tags for security, rendering functionality broken. This is a decent workaround.
