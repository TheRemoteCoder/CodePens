/*

Responsive and dynamic quote component example.

- The symbol should align with the text's top and must always be fully visible.
- Use a native font, to avoid FOUT (flash of unstyled type) when otherwise using custom fonts.
- Change alignment and scale according to viewport.

NOTES
- The actual implementation and settings might depend on the layout context, as well as the typeface chosen.
- It works as intended in Chrome (MacOS, 2023-07) but has not been tested anywhere else.
