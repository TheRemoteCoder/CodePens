PROOF OF CONCEPT

Alternating grid alignment:

The idea is to have intentionally overlapping areas, so they won't be able to auto-float and fill the gaps. This kind of layout can e.g. be used for timelines or roadmap visuals, where the content inside would be aligned above or below a certain area.

Alternative:
- Full size containers, with nested elements that get aligned in flipped order. This is probably better for visual alignment, as it does not rely on this kind of 'hack'.
