Idea: Flexible scaling with minimum configuration needed. Might be a solution that can work with CSS preprocessing generators.

Problem: It's not responsive and gap between tiles is not scalable.

Note: A rounding issue might appear in preview. Before implementation, it should be evaluated if that's the only place where this happens. This implementation worked in production during its creation. As browsers and engines change over time, this can't be guaranteed in the future.
